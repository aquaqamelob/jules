# Jules: AI LaTeX Editor

[Jules](https://juleseditor.com) is a proof of concept AI-Latex Editor. You select a range, type into the dialogue, and the LLM will (hopefully) create a diff that turns your natural language request into compileable LaTeX.

It has basic LaTeX project management features, like adding/deleting files and folders, images, svgs, etc. `main.tex` is required to compile.

Note this is a `proof-of-concept` and not a "production" application. There will be bugs, important missing features, and UX issues that make it not quite ready yet for daily usage.
